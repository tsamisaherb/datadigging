Uh oh look how many there are! To find the record you need you first need to know the exact name of the company. The best place to find this out is from the company itself. 

First it is best to go to the companyâ€™s website. You can find this through a simple online search: <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/">http://www.mitie.com/</a>  

Often the full name of the company is in the lower banner or in a legal document on the website like the privacy policy or terms and conditions.
